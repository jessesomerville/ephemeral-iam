var assumePrivilegesCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "assumePrivileges",
	Short: "Configure gcloud to make API calls as the provided service account",
	Long: `
The "assumePrivileges" command fetches short-lived credentials for the provided service Account
and configures gcloud to proxy its traffic through an auth proxy. This auth proxy sets the
authorization header to the OAuth2 token generated for the provided service account. Once
the credentials have expired, the auth proxy is shut down and the gcloud config is restored.

The reason flag is used to add additional metadata to audit logs.  The provided reason will
be in 'protoPatload.requestMetadata.requestAttributes.reason'.

Example:
  gcp_iam_escalate assumePrivileges \
      --serviceAccountEmail example@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
      --reason "Emergency security patch (JIRA-1234)"`,
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		project, err := gcpclient.GetCurrentProject()
		handleErr(err)

		hasAccess, err := gcpclient.CanImpersonate(project, serviceAccountEmail)
		handleErr(err)
		if !hasAccess {
			logger.Error("You do not have access to impersonate this service account")
			os.Exit(1)
		}

		logger.Info("Fetching short-lived access token for ", serviceAccountEmail)

		gcpClientWithReason, err := gcpclient.WithReason(reason)
		handleErr(err)
